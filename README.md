ZoberProjects
=============

This repository contains an application in python I started on. 
The purpose of the application is to log data from workouts and 
store them in a database. It contains two files- one containing
and the other containing the DB code. I used tKinter for the GUI,
and pyodbc for the DB. There is a lot of room for expansion and
improvement here!
